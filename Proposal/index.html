                <p class="card-text card-text-scrollable">I have been teaching Drama in an urban public high school for 10 years, and I continue to be amazed by my students&#039; determination despite the many obstacles they face.<br><br>When people ask me about my students, one of the first things they will notice in my response is how much I smile when I talk about them.  We all know that there are significant challenges in teaching an art form in a public school setting.  My students do not elect to take a Drama class.  Because our funding is so limited, there is a shortage of artistic options for students to fulfill their requirements for graduation.  While it is my largest challenge, this is also my favorite part of my job.  I have the opportunity to watch students go from no interest or exposure to an art form, to enthusiastically participating, and in some cases, pursuing theatre.  The most beautiful part about this process is watching these teenagers find their confidence and their voice.  <br><br>Through drama class, students collaborate and express themselves creatively while working toward a common goal.  They are often self-directed with only my support.  Not only does this help develop them as artists, but as leaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drama class should be a place where students can feel comfortable and express themselves.  Traditional chairs and desks often restrict the feel of the classroom in addition to adding challenges to the physical space.<br><br>Flexible seating in high school classrooms improves engagement and attendance, two of largest factors in determining overall success.   It gives students ownership of the space and allows for more student-centered learning.  Setting up an environment that supports collaboration and builds a sense of community will help foster creativity and risk-taking.  Not only are these key elements in creating a drama classroom where students can achieve their goals, but they are directly related to the 21st-Century skills that are necessary for a student&#039;s success past high school.  <br><br>In Drama class, our time is split between physical movement activities and reading/writing.  Desks and chairs are often obstacles in our classroom.  By having flexible seating options, it will allow us to use less time transitioning between activities and maximize learning!</p>
